# What's My Ward? #

Whatâ€™s My Ward is an app to help find what ward you live in, and provide contact information for your municipal representative.

The app is designed to be whitelabeled for re-use, simply change color codes, replace icons and update KML files.

### Whitelabel ###
* In XCode, duplicate the Saskatoon target with the name of your city (ex Regina)
* Right-click on your new target (ex Regina) select Get Info > Build tab > rename Product Name to name of city without spaces (ex Regina)
* Duplicate the /Themes/Saskatoon folder with the name of your city as folder name (ex /Themes/Regina)
* Replace each image in the folder with your own custom graphic, maintaining the image dimensions and filenames
* In XCode, on your new theme folder (ex /Themes/Regina) Right-Click > Get Info > Targets tab, uncheck Saskatoon and check your new target (ex Regina)
* You can now customize your app by editing the following properties in Info.plist in your new Themes folder
